## Scope of the project

The idea is to document this forgotten terminal*: with schematics, PCB scans, and ROMs dumps.

Front of the terminal*:

## Backstory of the omega 1000

Initally called Società Italiana Siemens per Impianti Elettrici, founded in 1898, in the 1980s it was rebranded as Italtel.  

Up until the 90s-00s it was specialised in phone and telecomunications.

The Omega 1000 "terminal" was released probably around 1985-1986.

It was sold by SIP, the biggest italian telecomunication company at the time.

# A terminal or a phone?

Up until now I kept referring to this device as a "terminal"; but what is it exactly?  

It's difficult to say. It's an hybrid; more than a phone but less than a terminal.  

The primary function is a phone.  

As you can see in the picture in the "Scope of the project" section it has a SIP "Cobra" handset grafted to it:

## Schematics

The schematics can contain errors (especially the analog section of the motherboard) therefore you use them at your own risk and are provided **AS IS**
