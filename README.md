## Scope of the project

The idea is to document this forgotten terminal*: with schematics, PCB scans, and ROMs dumps.

_*:technically speaking it's not a terminal_

## Current progress

While the schematic is almost completed, around 80-90%, the other aspects, such as ROM dumps, are at mearly 10-20% of completion.
