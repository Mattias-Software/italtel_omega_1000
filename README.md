## Scope of the project

The idea is to document this forgotten terminal*: with schematics, PCB scans, and ROMs dumps.

Front of the terminal*:

![Italtel omega 1000 terminal*](https://github.com/Mattias-Software/italtel_omega_1000/blob/main/imgs/terminal_front.JPG)

_*:technically speaking it's not a terminal_

## Current progress

While the schematic is almost completed, around 80-90%, the other aspects, such as ROM dumps, are at mearly 10-20% of completion.
